## Visualization 1: Average Building Square Footage by Usage Type

### Description
This visualization illustrates the average building square footage for each usage type. The x-axis shows the average square footage, while the y-axis lists the different usage types. This chart provides insights into the size of buildings based on their primary function.

### Design Choices
- **Encoding**:
  - Horizontal bar chart: Enables easy comparison of average square footage across categories.
  - Tooltip: Displays the specific values for `Square Footage`, `Usage Description`, and `Year Constructed` on hover.
- **Interactivity**:
  - A **year slider** is included to filter the data based on the year the building was constructed.
  - The slider dynamically updates the chart to focus on specific years, allowing for targeted analysis.
